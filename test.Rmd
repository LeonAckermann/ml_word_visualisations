- mallet will be supported later
- data is private therefore not included in repository

```{r}
source("./lda.R")
test <- get_topic_test(model_type = "textmineR",
                       num_topics = 150,
                       num_top_words = 5,
                       data_column = "wor_text",
                       diagnose_column = "miniGAD_diagnose",
                       save_dir = "./wor_text_textmineR_150",
                       load_dir = NULL)

view(test)
