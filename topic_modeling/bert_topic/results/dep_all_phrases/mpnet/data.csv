Because of the lack of opportunities in my local area, which has been made worse due to COVID-19, I have come to the realization that many of my plans and objectives that I had made for the next 12 months are simply unattainable and impossible. For the past 8 years I have had to deal with a profoundly bad form of depression, and this year was meant to mark a change in my life. However, with the national and international COVID-19 situation not getting any better, I don't think my future - when considering COVID-19, local economic opportunities, and my own living and financial situation - has anything that I can look forward to. Combined with the aforementioned issues is my autism, which has basically messed up my entire life, and will likely continue to do so - despite my best efforts, I just can't remove the awful pathologies that are the result of having autism spectrum disorder. I think at some point I will develop the courage to kill myself, but as of right now (and the past 8 years) I'm too scared of death to want to kill myself - despite having such a terrible life, which is quite amusing to me at times. I think my autism may also be one of the main reasons why I haven't been able to do much with my life for the past 8 years - such as getting a job.","My worries for my own physical, mental, and financial well-being have plagued my mind continuously for much of the past 8 years. I had plans to rectify all of the aforementioned worries by making substantial changes to my life this year, but the COVID-19 situation has destroyed that. Now my worries are revolving around the COVID-19 diesease, and my physical, mental and financial health. I'm just so concerned about my future right now because I feel stuck in miserable poverty. Despite my best efforts to engae myself in local training and other job-related courses for years, employers have shown no interest in me in any way. I'm also concerned about the social destabilization that is happening in the country I live in, and I think I need to move to a country that has a stable future - both socially and economically - but I can't even attempt to do that if I can't even get a job - and not being able to get a job has been the main reason for my worries over the past two weeks.",1.0,26.0,24.0,18.0,1,1,102

Certainly, it has been a happier time than the previous five months.  Prior to this my family of four were all living on top of each other with nowhere to go and trying to juggle a full-time job whilst entertaining two young children was stressful and led me to working late into the night with a lack of sleep.
Fortunately, the government relaxed the rules and allowed golf courses to open.  A group of my friends and I then decided to start to play golf for the first time in our lives and this enabled us to meet up for the first time in months.
I now play regularly once a week with friends and once a week on my own and use it as a form of meditation.
I was a keen gym-goer and now that the gyms have reopened I am also visiting several times a week.
The use of fitness combined with the fact my young family are now able to travel beyond our house has definitely led to an upturn in my own well-being and indeed those of the whole family.","I fear for the future firstly in terms of work and what the future will hold for myself and my family.  My work was predominantly home-based  so not much has changed in that perspective, visiting the office once a week.  Now there are so many preventative measures in place, which is totally understandable given the Covid situation but it definitely has made life and overall enjoyment very sterile.
We have adhered to the government advice regarding social distancing but it is quite depressing when you see others ignore it.
Thankfully my daughters are aged 2 and 4 and are two young to realise what liberties have been removed from their everyday life.  I really hope that some resolution can be found soon to ensure that they do not see people having to wear face masks in public for the next three to four years.  Things that they have enjoyed such as soft play have been taken away from them and simple childhood enjoyments of growing up playing with friends and cousins have been largely limited or controlled.
I then worry for my brother who lives in Barcelona, he cannot come home for a holiday this year for fear of being quarantined, missing out on time with his nieces.
My biggest fear then is for my family more so than myself.

The corruption present in the UK Government also deeply depresses me, with plum contracts being handed out to friends and cronies of people working in Government i.e. without any proper tendering process, or public accountability. The UK used to have a good reputation for fighting corruption but the current Government is dragging this country down. Not quite as bad as what Trump is doing to the USA, but not far off.

I'm very grateful for that. However I do have up and down moments.

COVID 19 has certainly placed a strain on this. Being labelled a key worker has meant I have had to continue going into work while others are at home. I work in a school with special needs children and with no disrespect meant, children will often have unsavory habits such as coughing/sneezing without covering their faces. Nose picking, farting, belching etc with no thought for others. The government under Boris Johnson (and like his pal Donald Trump in America ) have deemed kids at low risk of infection from COVID. However, I am certain children will get exposed to the virus and carry it on their clothes, shoes, and skin even if they do not suffer from it themselves. As they mingle in schools and then go home to all parts of my home town I often wonder who they are mixing with. Hence, I feel in a vulnerable situation. My age makes me at risk too although without any underlying health condition I must continue working.

So yes, I have ought depression and low mood but I have also taken some proactive steps to try to battle this. I think I have always been a highly sensitive person and with that comes the angst that most don't have to deal with. That's not to say other people have it easy or do not have problems.

I had been feeling down more than usual for previous six weeks because being so distant from most of my family for so long was highlighted by several family occasions that we had plans to celebrate, than then had to be cancelled. A lot of my family had to shield because of various chronic and terminal illnesses, which made it more frightening to be away from them for so long. But over a week ago that shielding period ended and we were able to go and visit a few people. Just being around family and hanging out, doing normal things, gave me a huge mental boost, brightening my mood and lifting my spirits. We've only met up twice so far but it has already impacted my mental health in a positive way.","There is rarely a day when I don't worry, but in the run up to reuniting with my sister and her family, my worries and anxieties were extremely high. My nephew is autistic and before the pandemic, I looked after him a lot of the time. He doesn't like a lot of people so he tends to have the same small number of people around him. Not being able to see him for four months was hard. Even though I'd video chat with my sister multiple times per week, he rarely came over to the phone/computer. 
So when the time came for me to go up and visit for the first time in months, I was really frightened he wouldn't be able to settle with me after so long. Every day for weeks leading up to the end of the shielding period, I thought about what his reaction might be more times in the day than I can remember. I always imagined a negative reaction, because that was what I was fearing the most. When the day finally arrived I went to three different shops to find these specific candy lollipops he likes, that I've used in the past to help him calm down during a tantrum episode. Then, the closer I drove to my sister's house, the more my stomach dropped with nerves. I even drove slower than I normally would, trying to extend the time it took to get there, because I felt like I needed the extra time to calm myself. I was afraid all of the hard work I'd done to help and play with my nephew had been undone because of a few months away from him.
Even when I arrived and got out of the car, I was bracing myself for a negative reaction. A tantrum. But thankfully, none of that happened. He was strange with me for about ten minutes, looking at me and then running away. But once I gave him a lollipop, that was it. We spent the afternoon playing in the garden, having fun.

However, I have had a somewhat constant low level bad mood for a while now, probably since the start of lockdown. Again, I wouldn't say this is depression, but it is certainly hard to shake even when good things happen. I think this is because I derive a lot of joy from making plans, and at the moment, with everything so uncertain, it is hard to be able to get excited about anything. Even things that I now do have planned I find it difficult to get excited about because I do not know whether they might be cancelled at a moments notice.","I seem to be able to always find something to worry about, and the global pandemic certainly hasn't helped matters. We are in the process of buying our first house so I have worried about every little thing connected with that, whether our mortgage application will get accepted, whether someone will pull out of the chain etc. I also find myself worrying about random highly unlikely scenarios. For example, we are hopefully taking a trip to the Outer Hebrides in Scotland in the middle of August (this was booked pre-covid) and whilst I should probably be worrying about the journey and visiting remote places where I could be bring the virus from a big city, the things I find myself worrying about more are things like - what if there is a massive thunderstorm and we are camping in an exposed area? How would we find shelter? Which leads me to then check the weather forecast obsessively. Or, there is one specific bit of road that we will be cycling on during our trip which I have convinced myself will be very busy and dangerous (there is no reason why I should think this). Both of these specific worries stem from previous events, my partner was hit by a car when we were on a cycling holiday in Croatia last year (he was thankfully fine but his bike was destroyed), and on the same trip we also got caught in a huge thunderstorm. The global pandemic has also led me to worry a lot about the future, specifically events that may not even happen and I have no control over, such as, what if things don't get back to ""normal"" for a long time and it will be too late to take the sabbatical we have been hoping to take to New Zealand? And, as a lot of my friends have started having children, I keep worrying about having a baby that is very sick. Often I find I will focus on one of these things, whether it be short term, long term, plausible or implausible, and worry about it obsessively until a different worry takes over, perhaps a few hours or few days later.",0.0,30.0,7.0,13.0,0,0,926
